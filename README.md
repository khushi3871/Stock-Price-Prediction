Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts next-day stock prices using historical stock market data and machine learning techniques.  
It is created for academic learning purposes to understand data preprocessing, model training, and prediction workflow.

Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

Project Files
- `load.py` – Loads and preprocesses the stock dataset  
- `predict.py` – Trains the model and predicts stock prices  
- `stock_data.csv` – Historical stock price dataset  

How to Run the Project
1. Install required libraries:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
2. Keep all files in the same folder  
3. Run the prediction script:
   python predict.py
Objective
- Learn machine learning workflow
- Understand stock market data handling
- Perform basic prediction using historical data

Disclaimer
Stock prices depend on many real-world factors.  
This project is for practice educational purposes and not financial advice.
